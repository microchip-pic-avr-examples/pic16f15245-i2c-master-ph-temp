# I2C Master Mode pH and Temperature Sensing using PIC16F15245

The 'pic16f15245-i2c-master-ph-temp' code example highlights the use of the PIC16F15245 micrcontroller to communicate two I2C slaves, and transmit the slave data through the Enhanced Universal Syncronous Asyncronous Receiver Transmitter (EUSART) module to a PC terminal program. The slave devices read their respective sensors, perform any necessary calculations, and prepares the data for I2C transmission. This project should be combined with the two slave code examples listed in the 'Related Documentation' section to create a complete I2C bus.

3. Using the two respective I2C slave boards from the 'pic16f15245-i2c-slave-ph-sensor' and 'pic16f15245-i2c-slave-temp-sensor' code examples, make the following connections as shown in Figure 3:
  1. Connect pin RB4 on the I2C master board to pin RB4 of one of the I2C slave boards.
  2. Connect pin RB4 on first I2C slave board to pin RB4 of the second slave board.
  3. Connect pin RB6 on the I2C master board to pin RB6 of the first slave board.
  4. Connect pin RB6 on the first slave board to pin RB6 of the second slave board.

4. Connect the I2C master's LPC board to a PC using the Micro-USB to USB 2.0 cable.
5. Program the PIC16F15245 Microcontroller:
   1. If not already on your system, download and install MPLABX IDE version 5.40 (or newer).
   2. If not already on your system, download and install the XC8 C-Compiler version 2.20 (or newer).
   3. Open the 'pic16f15245-i2c-master-ph-temp.X' project as shown in Figure 4.

7. Connect the two slave boards to the PC (or USB power supply) using the Micro-USB to USB 2.0 cables.

8. Press the 'Reset' button on each of the two slave boards, then on the master board.

## Operation

The I2C master continuously requests the pH, temperature, and water level data from the two slaves. Each slave must convert it's data into bytes, ,which are then transmitted to the master. As the master receives the slave data, it loads a software array. The master must then reconstruct the slave data back into its original format (see Figure 10). For example, the pH sensor data uses a 24-bit floating-point value, which must be deconstructed into three bytes for I2C transmission. When the master receives the pH data, it reconstructs the three bytes back into a 24-bit float.

Once the data has been reconstructed, the information is passed to the PC terminal program using 'printf' statements. Figure 11 shows the final output.
